# Mobile Flashcards Project

This React Native app was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). It was submitted for the third final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. It allows users to create decks of flashcards and to test their knowledge of each card in a deck. It has been tested for iOS devices.

## Getting Started

To start the app:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* start the iOS simulator with `i`

### TODOs
* add tests
* make Android-compatible
